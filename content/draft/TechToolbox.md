<p><em>Disclaimer: This blog post is based off of <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/03/23/your-tech-toolbox-the-middle-ground-between-tech-chaos-and-rigidity/">a very interesting article from Stack Overflow</a>. I highly recommend reading this article before reading this blog post however it's not necessary to understand this post.</em></p>

<h2>The concept of a "Tech Toolbox" explained</h2>

<p>A "tech toolbox" is a concept whereby an individual, group or company select a cultivated list of technologies that all their software solutions are built in. This holds several benefits (list taken from original article):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The team or company curates a list of approved tech. This list should be very small.</li>
  <li>The contents of the list should start with whatever the company is using at the moment.</li>
  <li>Each tech on the list should be given an overall status of approved, pending approval, discouraged, or not allowed.</li>
  <li>Further, each tech should be specific as to what use cases it is approved for. For example, Postgres might be approved for ad-hoc queries and internal tools, while MongoDB might be used for more performance-critical uses where the queries are well-known.</li>
  <li>All new projects must by default use tech on this list, and all other tech is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Approved tech are given official support by internal tools and our engineering guilds. All other tech is not supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the concept of a tech toolbox is perhaps more suited to teams and companies but I think it's interesting, even if just notionally, to explore the concept within the context of my own personal development.</p>

<h2>The Technologies I Can Use</h2>

<p>I have quite a few technologies at my disposal that I can use (with varying degrees of competency and knowledge) however using all of them is neither feasible, nor in keeping with the concept of a toolbox. A good set of evaluation metrics for each technology in my opinion are Familiarity, Competence, Usefulness and Wider Adoption. Familiarity is how familiar (as measured in months and years) I am with a technology. Competence is how comfortable I feel using those technologies and my perceived ability with that tech. Usefulness is a tough metric as it's non-quantitative, however I'll define it as "how useful a given technology is at solving the most common problems <em>I</em> would apply it to". By this I mean something like jQuery is very useful for compatibility but not really for much else. Finally, Wider Adoption is how easily I can find assistance with issues that crop up from using this technology, something that I deem to be synonymous with how heavily adopted the technology is within the tech sector.</p>

<p>Now, with that absolute wall of text out of the way, here's my list of tech that I <em>could</em> use for my toolbox:</p>
