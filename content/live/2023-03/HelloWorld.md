<h1 class="text-3xl py-4 font-bold">Welcome to my Blog!</h1>
<p>This blog is going to be somewhere for me to post about topics I care about, rant about random things and generally express myself and scream pointlessly into this void we call the internet.</p>

<h2 class="text-lg pt-4 pb-2 font-bold">My Site's Stack.</h2>

<p>I decided to go with Nuxt, Vue, Nuxt Content and Tailwind for my site. It's a fairly simple stack but there's a lot of power in simplicity. Nuxt/Vue is my go-to framework for new web projects. It's so simple and so powerful. I'm aware that using Nuxt for small single page projects and apps probably incurs a significant processing overhead but I'm fine with that. Nuxt Content was recommended to me by a fantastic, talented coworker of mine, <a href="https://github.com/cguttweb/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-400 visited:text-purple-600">Chloe Guttridge.</a> After playing around with it for a bit I found that, other than the small issue of filtering by tags in my post metadata, it was perfect. Simple and elegant, exactly what I like in my stack.</p>
<br />
<p>Speaking of simple and elegant, that brings me nicely onto my last stack component; TailwindCSS. Tailwind is an absolute staple for me now. Yes, I know the HTML you write with it looks horrific. But once you get past that, it's incredible. I love the modifier syntax (<code>hover:</code>, <code>md:</code>, etc) and the power of tree-shaking means I don't have to worry about deploying awful, huge bundles!</p>
